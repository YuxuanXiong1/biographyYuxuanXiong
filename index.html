    <h2>RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <h3>Brandeis University, Michtom School of Computer Science</h3>
    <p>Research Assistant for Professor <a href="https://dylancashman.github.io">Dylan Cashman</a>. MA, USA (Jan 2023 – Present)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Conducted comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of machine learning
            packages across multiple prominent open-source repositories
            (GitHub, CRAN, PyPI, Anaconda). This included the examination and classification
            of approximately 300-400 machine learning visualizations based on their visual encoding techniques,
            following Leilani Battle’s established classification method.
            The study aimed to identify trends in visualization practices
            and assess their effectiveness in conveying complex machine learning concepts.</li>
        <li>Developed an interactive bubble chart to visually represent the popularity, categorization, and usage patterns of various ML packages. This visualization tool not only provided insights into the current landscape of machine learning tools but also facilitated comparative analysis of different packages based on their adoption and application in various domains.</li>
        <li>Constructed a comprehensive guideline for the machine learning community, detailing best practices for effectively applying different methods of visualization within diverse computational environments. This guideline incorporated theoretical frameworks and practical insights, aiming to enhance the clarity and interpretability of machine learning models through appropriate visualization techniques.</li>
        <li>Presented research findings at a series of departmental seminars and retreats, addressing professional audiences that included academics, industry experts, and fellow researchers. These presentations involved detailed methodological explanations, data-driven insights, and discussions on the implications of visualization practices in machine learning.</li>
        <li>Drafted the methodology and analysis sections for a submitted short paper, articulating the research process, analytical techniques employed, and the significance of the findings. The paper aimed to contribute to the academic discourse on the role of visualization in enhancing the comprehensibility and transparency of machine learning models.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Brandeis University, Department of Economics</h3>
    <p>Research Assistant for Professor <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/gle/bio-0">Galit Eizman</a>. MA, USA (Jan 2023 – Present)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Conducted an in-depth study using R for data analysis to examine the impact of agglomeration effects on industries, focusing on how environmental factors, such as the density of educational institutions, influence income levels. This involved applying advanced statistical techniques and econometric methods to ensure robust and accurate results, contributing to the broader understanding of regional economic development and policy implications.</li>
        <li>Collected and meticulously curated data from various authoritative sources, developed a unique and comprehensive dataset, and constructed sophisticated multiple regression models to evaluate the comparative income advantages of schools situated in high-density university areas versus those in isolated locations. The models were rigorously tested for validity and reliability, employing techniques such as heteroscedasticity testing, multicollinearity diagnostics, and goodness-of-fit measures.</li>
        <li>Implemented several machine learning algorithms, including clustering algorithms and time series analysis, to examine and predict the geographical allocation of higher education within the United States. This involved developing and optimizing predictive models to identify trends and patterns in educational institution distribution and their economic impacts, using methods such as k-means clustering for identifying regional clusters and ARIMA models for time series forecasting.</li>
        <li>Leveraged machine learning techniques to enhance the analytical depth of the study, using tools such as supervised learning for regression tasks, unsupervised learning for clustering, and advanced time series forecasting methods to predict future trends based on historical data. This integration of machine learning approaches with traditional econometric analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic relationships between educational density and economic outcomes.</li>
        <li>Engaged in extensive literature review and theoretical analysis to contextualize the empirical findings within the broader framework of agglomeration economics and urban studies. This included examining seminal works and contemporary studies on the economic benefits of educational clusters, spillover effects, and regional economic growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>University of Tokyo, Department of Economics</h3>
    <p>Research Assistant for Professor <a href="https://www.iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp/mystaff/weese_e.html">Eric Weese</a>. Tokyo, Japan (Jun 2023 – Oct 2023)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Conducted in-depth research on the supply relationships between Japanese automobile part suppliers and automobile brands, analyzing industry dynamics and partnerships.</li>
        <li>Involved in rigorous data analysis and cleaning processes using R, which included organizing, filtering, and interpreting data sets to ensure accuracy and relevance.</li>
        <li>Developed and set up event studies to assess the impact of various factors on the supply chain, employing statistical methods and regression analysis in R to draw meaningful conclusions.</li>
